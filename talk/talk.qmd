## Background & acknowledgment

- I'm a philosopher of science, STSer, data scientist
    - Science, values, and policy
    - Public scientific controversies
- Emilio is a cognitive psychologist
    - Conspiracy theories & other \
      "epistemically unwarranted beliefs"
    - Relationship between prejudice and EUBs
</br>
- This project was funded out of my faculty startup funds at UC Merced


# Controversy and public understanding of science # {center="true"}

## Explaining public scientific controversies {.smaller}

HPSTSers often explain controversies by appeal to public views on\ 
science, values, and policy issues

- "The scientific method" [@MercerWhyPopperCan2016; @JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017]
- Objectivity & value-free ideal [VFI] [@FernandezPintoLegitimizingValuesRegulatory2019; @KovakaClimateChangeDenial2021]
- Consensus and dissent [@OreskesScientificConsensusClimate2004; @CookQuantifyingConsensusAnthropogenic2013; @JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017; @MyersConsensusRevisitedQuantifying2021]
- Paternalism/technocracy/elitism \
    [@WynneSheepfarmingChernobylCase1989; @JordanTrustworthinessResearchParadigm2011; @LargentVaccineDebateModern2012; @NavinValuesVaccineRefusal2015; @GoldenbergVaccineHesitancyPublic2021]
- Conflicts of interest, manufacturing doubt or certainty \
    [@ElliottSciencePolicyTransparency2014; @FernandezPintoCommercialInterestsErosion2020; @GoldenbergVaccineHesitancyPublic2021]
- Science's historical and/or contemporary role in oppression \
    [@SchemanEpistemologyResuscitatedObjectivity2001; @WashingtonMedicalApartheidDark2008; @McHughMoreSkinDeep2011; @NelsonBodySoulBlack2011; @GrasswickUnderstandingEpistemicTrust2018;  @GoldenbergVaccineHesitancyPublic2021]

## But do the public hold these views? 

(As a gross generalization)

- Historians focus on actions of scientists or merchants of doubt
- Sociologists look at very particular case studies that don't generalize to public at large
- Philosophers don't offer any empirical evidence

## A few notable exceptions {style="font-size:80%"}

- <normsize>@WeisbergKnowledgeNatureScience2020</normsize>
    - Evolution/creationism, climate, vaccines
    - Using a "Nature of Science" instrument
      [@LombrozoImportanceUnderstandingNature2008]
    - But don't include any items from the science, values, and policy literature [[Table 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/pusa/2021/pusa_30_2/0963662520977700/20210201/images/large/10.1177_0963662520977700-table1.jpeg){target="_blank"}]
        
- <normsize>@ElliottValuesEnvironmentalResearch2017</normsize>
    - Does transparency about values in science reduce trust? 
    - Online survey experiment
    - But don't ask about participants' views on, eg, VFI

- <normsize>@HicksValuesDisclosuresTrust2022</normsize>
    - Replication study of Elliott et al.
    - Found values disclosures did not reduce trust
    - Which values matter: public health vs. economic growth
    - Included a first draft of VISS, but found evidence of construct invalidity

## Agreement/disagreement: </br> Interpretation ##

In the US, members of the public

- think science has both epistemic and practical aims *[me]*
- recognize the influence of "special interests" *[Manuela, Holman]*
- agree with a version of standpoint's epistemic advantage thesis *[Crasnow]*
- [*nevertheless, accept VFI*]{.red}
- are fallibilists *[cite?]*
- recognize both epistemically-based consensus *[Boaz]* and legitimate scientific disagreement *[Longino]*


# VFI and some critiques {.scrollable}

## VFI and some critiques

### Two statements of VFI

nonsubj.1
  ~ When analyzing data, scientists should let the data speak for itself rather than offering their own interpretation. 
  
vfi.1
  ~ The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values. 

### Four arguments against VFI

aims.2
  ~ A primary aim of science is to improve our understanding of threats to human health and the environment.

ir
  ~ Scientists should be more cautious about accepting a hypothesis when doing so could have serious social consequences. 

stdpt
  ~ Scientists from marginalized backgrounds can provide valuable insights that other scientists are likely to miss. 

value.conflict
  ~ When scientific findings conflict with my core values, it's appropriate to be especially skeptical. 
  
## VFI and some critiques

![](../out/03/02_vfi.png){width=100% style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"}

## VFI and some critiques: Interpretation

- No correlation between statements of VFI and critiques
- [***Not***]{.red}: \
   Public is irrational, inconsistent, etc.
- [***Rather***]{.blue}: \
   Public haven't yet had the opportunity to think through these issues


# VISS factors and trust


# Future work #

## Future work {}

- Qualitative designs to revise prompts
    - Paraphrase the prompt; think aloud
    - Likely will reduce measurement error
- Other endpoints
    - Dueling expert scenarios
    - Trust in science-policy institutions (EPA) rather than individual scientists [@BrownTrustExpertiseScientific2022\; Biddle yesterday]
    - Policy support

coi-2
: Special interests can always find an scientist-for-hire who will support their point of view.

coi-3

consensus-2
: Scientists rarely disagree with each other about the answers to scientific questions.

consensus-3
: The consensus of the scientific community is based on social status and prestige rather than evidence. 

factvalue-1
: Moral and social values are the kinds of things that can be confirmed or challenged by scientific evidence. 

factvalue-2
: If scientific findings conflict with important values that we hold, it's appropriate to be skeptical of the science.

factvalue-3
: Someone's moral and social values are more like their taste in music than scientific facts.

fallible-1
: Once a scientific theory has been established, it is never changed.^K^

fallible-2
: When a scientific theory changes or is revised, it means that the research that went into it initially was flawed.

fallible-3
: Scientific findings can be good enough to act on even when they're not entirely certain. 

ir-1
: Standards of scientific evidence are different in different situations.

ir-2
: Scientists are not responsible for harmful effects of the technologies they develop.

ir-3
: When scientific research has potential consequences for society, scientists must take these consequences into account when drawing conclusions.

nonsubj-1
: The results of scientific studies are always ambiguous and require interpretation.

nonsubj-2
: Good scientific research is always free of assumptions and speculation.

nonsubj-3
: Scientific conclusions are never a matter of interpretation or judgment.

pluralism-1
: Scientific investigations always require laboratory experiments.^K^

pluralism-2
: Scientific research is always conducted in the following order: 1. Observation, 2. Hypothesis, 3. Experiment, 4. Conclusion^K^

pluralism-3
: All scientists use the same strict requirements for determining when empirical data confirm a tested hypothesis.

scientism-1
: Science is more reliable than any other way of producing knowledge.

scientism-2
: Everyone, whatever their worldview, should accept evidence-based scientific conclusions

scientism-3
: Science is the only source of justified belief or knowledge about ourselves and the world.

stdpt-1
: A scientific understanding of the social word depends on the background of the scientists carrying out the research.

stdpt-2
: People on the margins of society often have a unique understanding of that society that can benefit scientific research. 

stdpt-3
: Science has a long history of ignoring the unique insights of women and people of color.

technocracy-1
: Public policy should wait until all relevant scientific questions have been settled.

technocracy-2
: When it comes to public policy, scientific evidence is more important than public opinion. 

technocrac-3
: Scientists have too much influence over public policy today. 

vfi-1
: Scientists are more objective than other people.^K^

vfi-2
: Scientists do not use imagination or creativity because doing so interferes with objectivity.^K^

vfi-3
: The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values.^K^
