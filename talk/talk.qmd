# Controversy and public understanding of science # {center="true"}

## Explaining public scientific controversies

:::: {.v-center}
HPSTSers often explain controversies by appeal to public views on\ 
science, values, and policy issues

::: {.smallish}
- "The scientific method" [@MercerWhyPopperCan2016; @JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017]
- Objectivity & value-free ideal [VFI] [@FernandezPintoLegitimizingValuesRegulatory2019; @KovakaClimateChangeDenial2021]
- Consensus and dissent [@OreskesScientificConsensusClimate2004; @CookQuantifyingConsensusAnthropogenic2013; @JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017; @MyersConsensusRevisitedQuantifying2021]

## But do publics actually hold these views? 

:::: {.v-center}
(As a gross generalization)

- Historians focus on actions of scientists or merchants of doubt
- Sociologists look at particular case studies that don't necessarily generalize to public at large
- Philosophers don't offer empirical evidence at all

## Item example ##

:::{.v-center}
vfi.1
  ~ The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values. 
  
- 7-step Likert scale
- "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree"
:::


## VISS project 


- Collaboration between a philosopher of science (Dan) and a cognitive scientist (Emilio)
- Fall 2021: initial development of 36-item quantitative scale
- January 2024: Cosmo and Joseph, both philosophy majors, brought on as USRs
- March 2024: focus on 19 items, qualitative surveys to refine wording
- April 2024
    - Validation study
    - 502 US adults via Prolific
    - VISS + measures of trust in science, science literacy, right-wing authoritarianism

## Agreement/disagreement: </br> Interpretation {.smallish}

In the US, members of the public generally

- are fallibilists [@UpshurCounteringMedicalNihilism2020]
- recognize both epistemically-based consensus [@MillerWhenConsensusKnowledge2013] and legitimate scientific disagreement [@LonginoScienceSocialKnowledge1990; @Melo-MartinFightDoubtHow2018]
- recognize the influence of "special interests" \
  [@FernandezPintoKnowBetterNot2017; @HolmanExperimentationIndustrialSelection2017]

\

- think science has both epistemic and practical aims [@HicksWhenVirtuesAre2022]
- agree with a version of standpoint's epistemic advantage thesis [@CrasnowFeministStandpointTheory2014]
- [*nevertheless, accept VFI*]{.red}


# VFI and some critiques

## Two statements of VFI

nonsubj.1
  ~ When analyzing data, scientists should let the data speak for itself rather than offering their own interpretation. 
  
vfi.1
  ~ The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values. 

## Four arguments against VFI

aims.2
  ~ A primary aim of science is to improve our understanding of threats to human health and the environment.

ir
  ~ Scientists should be more cautious about accepting a hypothesis when doing so could have serious social consequences. 

stdpt
  ~ Scientists from marginalized backgrounds can provide valuable insights that other scientists are likely to miss. 

value.conflict
  ~ When scientific findings conflict with my core values, it's appropriate to be especially skeptical. 
  
## VFI and some critiques

![](img/02_vfi.png){width=100% style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;"}

## VFI and some critiques: Interpretation

::: {.v-center}
- No correlation between statements of VFI and critiques
- [***Not***]{.red}: \
   Public is irrational, inconsistent, etc.
- [***Rather***]{.blue}: Dewey model\
    - Cultural "scripts," habitual modes of thought [@DeweyHumanNatureConduct2008]
    - "Activated" in particular cases for interpretation or meaning-making [@HalpernScienceExperienceDeweyan2022]
    - So long as two "scripts" aren't "activated" in the same context in a way that brings them into conflict, there's no problematic situation and thus no reason to try to reconcile them [@DeweyLogicTheoryInquiry2008; @BrownScienceMoralImagination2020].

# VFI items and trust

## Measures of generalized trust in science

::: {.v-center}
- Credibility of Science Scale [@HartmanModelingAttitudesScience2017]
- Variation on "confidence in institutions" questions from the General Social Survey [(<https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/458/vshow>)]{.smaller}
- Pew Research Center "effect of science on society" \
  [(<https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/views-on-the-impact-of-science-on-society/>)]{.smaller}
- Scientism scale [@LukicDelineatingScientismScience2023]
:::

## VFI items and trust

![](img/02_trust.png){style="margin: 100px 0px 0px 0px;"}

## VFI items and trust

::: {.v-center}
- For both measures, median trust in science is moderately high
- None of the VFI items is a strong predictor of trust
- Heterogeneity of correlations: \
  some positive, some negative, vfi.1 is almost perfectly flat
- We plan to analyze this heterogeneity using exploratory causal methods

# Future work #

## Future work

::: {.v-center}
- VFI & testing "Deweyan model"
- Relationship between VFI items and politics

VISS items in the context of

- Dueling expert scenarios
- Trust in science-policy institutions (EPA) rather than individual scientists or "science" [@BrownTrustExpertiseScientific2022]
- Policy support

## {.placeholder-for-titleSlide visibility='uncounted'}


## Prompts {.scrollable visibility='uncounted'}

aims.1
  ~ A primary aim of science is to improve our knowledge and understanding of the world. 

aims.2
  ~ A primary aim of science is to improve our understanding of threats to human health and the environment.

aims.3
  ~ A primary aim of science is to stimulate economic growth with new technology. 

coi.1
  ~ Scientists will report conclusions that they think will get them more funding even if the data does not fully support that conclusion.

coi.2
  ~ Special interests can always find a scientist-for-hire who will support their point of view. 

consensus.1
  ~ The consensus of the scientific community is based on social status and prestige rather than evidence. 

consensus.2
  ~ Scientists never disagree with each other about the answers to scientific questions. 

fallible.1
  ~ Once a scientific theory has been established, it is never changed. 

fallible.2
  ~ When a scientific theory changes or is revised, it means that the research that went into it initially was flawed. 

ir
  ~ Scientists should be more cautious about accepting a hypothesis when doing so could have serious social consequences. 

nonsubj.1
  ~ When analyzing data, scientists should let the data speak for itself rather than offering their own interpretation. 

nonsubj.2
  ~ Good scientific research is always free of assumptions and speculation.

pluralism.1
  ~ Scientific investigations always require laboratory experiments.

pluralism.3
  ~ All scientists use the same strict requirements for determining when empirical data confirms a tested hypothesis. 

stdpt
  ~ Scientists from marginalized backgrounds can provide valuable insights that other scientists are likely to miss. 

value.conflict
  ~ When scientific findings conflict with my core values, it's appropriate to be especially skeptical. 

vfi.1
  ~ The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values.

vfi.2
  ~ Scientists do not use imagination or creativity because doing so interferes with objectivity. 

wait.policy
  ~ Public policy should wait until all relevant scientific questions have been settled.
