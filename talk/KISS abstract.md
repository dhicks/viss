Developing a Values in Science Scale (VISS)

Scholars in the history, philosophy, and social studies of science often explain public scientific controversies by appealing to views of the general public on issues of science and values.  For example, Kovaka (2021) has hypothesized that the climate controversy might be explained by the mismatch between public expectations of value-free science and the value-laden reality.  Other scholars offer explanations that appeal to public views about scientific consensus and dissent (Oreskes 2004; John 2017); paternalism, technocracy, or elitism (Wynne 1989; Largent 2012); conflicts of interest and manufacturing doubt and/or certainty (Fernández Pinto 2017); and science's historical and/or contemporary roles in perpetrating and/or redressing injustice and oppression (Warren et al. 2020).  However, evidence whether and to what extent members of the public actually hold these views is limited.  

The Values in Science Scale (VISS) project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between a cognitive psychologist and a philosopher of science.  The project aims to develop a survey instrument that can be used to assess public views on values in science.  In spring 2022, initial work on the project yielded a number of notable preliminary findings.  For example: 

-  almost all respondents rejected scientific infallibilism ("Once a scientific theory has been established, it is never changed") 
- a slightly smaller supermajority rejected an irrational view of scientific consensus ("The consensus of the scientific community is based on social status and prestige rather than evidence")
- about two-thirds of respondents supported statements of scientific epistemic priority ("Everyone, whatever their worldview, should accept evidence-based scientific conclusions") and technocracy ("When it comes to public policy, scientific evidence is more important than public opinion.")

Exploratory factor analysis suggested that various composite measures — which we labelled scientism, cynicism, and textbook science — might be especially important.  However, analysis also indicated that at least some of the prompts used in the initial version of the instrument were ambiguous and lacked construct validity (that is, they did not necessarily measure what they were intended to measure).  

This presentation provides an update on the project.  In February and March, we plan to rapidly iterate the wording of the VISS items using a small-sample qualitative approach.  This effort is expected to ensure construct validity and reduce ambiguity.  Our short-term goal is to run at least one quantitative assessment study in April with a representative sample of US adults.  Data from this study will be used in a second exploratory factor analysis and to compare VISS with some common measures of trust in the scientific community (e.g., as used on the General Social Survey).  


Relevance to the aims of the conference

As an interdisciplinary collaboration that is using empirical methods to assess philosophical claims, we believe this project fits well with the overall aim of promoting cross-disciplinary exchange.  As indicated by the abstract, the project examines the role that a number of conference topics might play in shaping public trust in science and the bounds of scientific authority and expertise.  


Disciplinary affiliation

The project uses methods from psychology.  The talk will be addressed to a multidisciplinary audience, and most likely will be delivered by the project PI, who is a philosopher of science and STS scholar.
