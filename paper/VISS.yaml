  abstract: >-
    Trust in science is polarized along political lines—but why? We show across
    a series of highly controlled studies (total N = 2,859) and a large-scale
    Twitter analysis (N = 3,977,868) that people across the political spectrum
    hold stereotypes about scientists’ political orientation (e.g., “scientists
    are liberal”) and that these stereotypes decisively affect the link between
    their own political orientation and their trust in scientists. Critically,
    this effect shaped participants’ perceptions of the value of science,
    protective behavior intentions during a pandemic, policy support, and
    information-seeking behavior. Therefore, these insights have important
    implications for effective science communication.

    The underdetermination argument establishes that scientists may use
    political values to guide inquiry, without providing criteria for
    distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate guidance. This paper supplies
    such criteria. Analysis of the confused arguments against value-laden
    science reveals the fundamental criterion of illegitimate guidance: when
    value judgments operate to drive inquiry to a predetermined conclusion. A
    case study of feminist research on divorce reveals numerous legitimate ways
    that values can guide science without violating this standard.

  abstract: >-
    Given that an estimated 0.6% of the U.S. population is transgender (trans)
    and that large health disparities for this population have been documented,
    government and research organizations are increasingly expanding measures of
    sex/gender to be trans inclusive. Options suggested for trans community
    surveys, such as expansive check-all-that-apply gender identity lists and
    write-in options that offer maximum flexibility, are generally not
    appropriate for broad population surveys. These require limited questions
    and a small number of categories for analysis. Limited evaluation has been
    undertaken of trans-inclusive population survey measures for sex/gender,
    including those currently in use. Using an internet survey and follow-up of
    311 participants, and cognitive interviews from a maximum-diversity
    sub-sample (n = 79), we conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of two existing
    measures: a two-step question developed in the United States and a
    multidimensional measure developed in Canada. We found very low levels of
    item missingness, and no indicators of confusion on the part of cisgender
    (non-trans) participants for both measures. However, a majority of interview
    participants indicated problems with each question item set. Agreement
    between the two measures in assessment of gender identity was very high (K =
    0.9081), but gender identity was a poor proxy for other dimensions of sex or
    gender among trans participants. Issues to inform measure development or
    adaptation that emerged from analysis included dimensions of sex/gender
    measured, whether non-binary identities were trans, Indigenous and cultural
    identities, proxy reporting, temporality concerns, and the inability of a
    single item to provide a valid measure of sex/gender. Based on this
    evaluation, we recommend that population surveys meant for multi-purpose
    analysis consider a new Multidimensional Sex/Gender Measure for testing that
    includes three simple items (one asked only of a small sub-group) to assess
    gender identity and lived gender, with optional additions. We provide
    considerations for adaptation of this measure to different contexts.

  abstract: >-
    The aim of this paper is to address the neglected but important problem of
    differentiating between epistemically beneficial and epistemically
    detrimental dissent. By “dissent,” we refer to the act of objecting to a
    particular conclusion, especially one that is widely held. While dissent in
    science can clearly be beneficial, there might be some instances of dissent
    that not only fail to contribute to scientific progress, but actually impede
    it. Potential examples of this include the tobacco industry’s funding of
    studies that questioned the link between smoking and lung cancer, and the
    attempt by the petroleum industry and other groups to cast doubt upon the
    conclusion that human consumption of fossil fuels contributes to global
    climate change. The problem of distinguishing between good and bad dissent
    is important because of the growing tendency of some stakeholders to attempt
    to delay political action by ’manufacturing doubt’ (Oreskes & Conway 2010).
    Our discussion in this paper focuses on climate science. This field, in our
    view, is rife with instances of bad dissent. On the basis of our discussion
    of climate science, we articulate a set of sufficient conditions for
    epistemically problematic dissent in general, which we call “the inductive
    risk account of epistemically detrimental dissent.”

  abstract: >-
    Measurement of shared cultural schemas is a central methodological challenge
    for the sociology of culture. Relational Class Analysis (RCA) is a recently
    developed technique for identifying such schemas in survey data. However,
    existing work lacks a clear deﬁnition of such schemas, which leaves RCA’s
    accuracy largely unknown. Here, I build on the theoretical intuitions behind
    RCA to arrive at this deﬁnition. I demonstrate that shared schemas should
    result in linear dependencies between survey rows—the relationship usually
    measured with Pearson’s correlation. I thus modify RCA into a “Correlational
    Class Analysis” (CCA). When I compare the methods using a broad set of
    simulations, results show that CCA is reliably more accurate at detecting
    shared schemas than RCA, even in scenarios that substantially violate CCA’s
    assumptions. I ﬁnd no evidence of theoretical settings where RCA is more
    accurate. I then revisit a previous RCA analysis of the 1993 General Social
    Survey musical tastes module. Whereas RCA partitioned these data into three
    schematic classes, CCA partitions them into four. I compare these results
    with a multiple-groups analysis in structural equation modeling and ﬁnd that
    CCA’s partition yields greatly improved model ﬁt over RCA. I conclude with a
    parsimonious framework for future work.

  abstract: "Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias:\_an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi–Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi–Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14–20 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11–17 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios–Ipsos\_online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We\_then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the\_population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition."

  abstract: >-
    A bracingly provocative challenge to one of our most cherished ideas and
    institutionsMost people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of
    government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of
    political power. And they believe that political participation is good for
    us—it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter,
    more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most
    cherished ideas about democracy. But Jason Brennan says they are all
    wrong.In this trenchant book, Brennan argues that democracy should be judged
    by its results—and the results are not good enough. Just as defendants have
    a right to a fair trial, citizens have a right to competent government. But
    democracy is the rule of the ignorant and the irrational, and it all too
    often falls short. Furthermore, no one has a fundamental right to any share
    of political power, and exercising political power does most of us little
    good. On the contrary, a wide range of social science research shows that
    political participation and democratic deliberation actually tend to make
    people worse—more irrational, biased, and mean. Given this grim picture,
    Brennan argues that a new system of government—epistocracy, the rule of the
    knowledgeable—may be better than democracy, and that it's time to experiment
    and find out.A challenging critique of democracy and the first sustained
    defense of the rule of the knowledgeable, Against Democracy is essential
    reading for scholars and students of politics across the
    disciplines.Featuring a new preface that situates the book within the
    current political climate and discusses other alternatives beyond
    epistocracy, Against Democracy is a challenging critique of democracy and
    the first sustained defense of the rule of the knowledgeable.

    The disconnect problem arises wherever there is ongoing and severe
    discordance between the scientific assessment of a politically relevant
    issue, and the politics and legislation of said issue. Here, we focus on the
    disconnect problem as it arises in the case of climate change, diagnosing a
    failure to respect the necessary tradeoff between authority and autonomy
    within a public institution like science. After assessing the problematic
    deployment of scientific authority in this arena, we offer suggestions for
    how to mitigate climate change’s particular disconnect problem, as well as
    more general proposals for reforming science advising.

  abstract: >-
    The idea that science is or should be value-free, and that values are or
    should be formed independently of science, has been under fire by
    philosophers of science for decades. Science and Moral Imagination directly
    challenges the idea that science and values cannot and should not influence
    each other. Matthew J. Brown argues that science and values mutually
    influence and implicate one another, that the influence of values on science
    is pervasive and must be responsibly managed, and that science can and
    should have an influence on our values. This interplay, he explains, must be
    guided by accounts of scientific inquiry and value judgment that are
    sensitive to the complexities of their interactions. Brown presents
    scientific inquiry and value judgment as types of problem-solving practices
    and provides a new framework for thinking about how we might ethically
    evaluate episodes and decisions in science, while offering guidance for
    scientific practitioners and institutions about how they can incorporate
    value judgments into their work. His framework, dubbed "the ideal of moral
    imagination," emphasizes the role of imagination in value judgment and the
    positive role that value judgment plays in science.

    Despite widespread trust in scientists, efforts to curtail their influence
    suggest some Americans distrust scientists and may even perceive them to be
    a social threat. Using panel survey data, we examine who holds this
    viewpoint and potential implications of threat perceptions. Results suggest
    Republicans and Evangelical identifying individuals perceived more social
    threat from scientists. News media uses were associated with threat
    perceptions in divergent ways. Threat perceptions were strongly associated
    with inaccurate science beliefs, support for excluding scientists from
    policy-making, and retributive actions toward scientists. Findings highlight
    the importance of social identity considerations amid concerns about
    partisan social sorting and politicization of science.

  abstract: >-
    I have argued that political values are beliefs informed, more or less well,
    by the evidence of experience and that, where relevant and well-supported by
    evidence, the inclusion of political values in scientific theorizing can
    increase the objectivity of research (e.g., Clough 2003, 2004, 2011). The
    position I endorse has been called the “values-as-evidence” approach
    (Goldenberg 2013). In this essay I respond to three kinds of resistance to
    this approach, using examples of feminist political values. Solomon (2012)
    questions whether values are beliefs that can be tested, Alcoff (2006)
    argues that even if our values are beliefs that can be tested, testing them
    might not be desirable because doing so assigns these important values a
    contingency that weakens their normative force, and Yap (2016) argues that
    the approach is too idealistic in its articulation of the role of evidence
    in our political deliberations. In response, I discuss the ways that values
    can be tested, I analyze the evidential strength of feminist values in
    science, and I argue that the evidence-based nature of these values is
    neither a weakness nor an idealization. Problems with political values
    affecting science properly concern the dogmatic ways that evaluative beliefs
    are sometimes held—a problem that arises with dogmatism toward descriptive
    beliefs as well. I conclude that scientists, as with the rest of us, ought
    to adopt a pragmatically-inclined appreciation of the fallible, inductive
    process by which we gather evidence in support of any of our beliefs,
    whether they are described as evaluative or descriptive.

  abstract: >-
    We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global
    warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944
    climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics ‘global climate change’
    or ‘global warming’. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position
    on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about
    the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW,
    97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global
    warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their
    own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated
    papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers
    expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both
    abstract ratings and authors’ self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements
    among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time.
    Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on
    AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.

  abstract: >-
    Feminist philosophy of science appears to present problems for the ideal of
    value-free science. These difficulties also challenge a traditional
    understanding of the objectivity of science. However, feminist philosophers
    of science have good reasons for desiring to retain some concept of
    objectivity. The present essay considers several recent and influential
    feminist approaches to the role of social and political values in science,
    with particular focus on feminist empiricism and feminist standpoint theory.
    The similarities and difference, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of
    these approaches are explored. The essay concludes with suggestions for
    future research in the area of feminist epistemology and philosophy of
    science.

    Following an exploratory factor analysis, factor scores may be computed and
    used in subsequent analyses. Factor scores are composite variables which
    provide information about an individual's placement on the factor(s). This
    article discusses popular methods to create factor scores under two
    different classes: refined and non-refined. Strengths and considerations of
    the various methods, and for using factor scores in general, are discussed.

  abstract: >-
    Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) has been conceptualized and measured as a
    unidimensional personality construct comprising the covariation of the three
    traits of authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and
    conventionalism. However, new approaches have criticized this
    conceptualization and instead viewed these three “traits” as three distinct,
    though related, social attitude dimensions. Here we extend this approach
    providing clear definitions of these three dimensions as ideological
    attitude constructs of Authoritarianism, Conservatism, and Traditionalism.
    These dimensions are seen as attitudinal expressions of basic social values
    or motivational goals that represent different, though related, strategies
    for attaining collective security at the expense of individual autonomy. We
    report data from five samples and three different countries showing that
    these three dimensions could be reliably measured and were factorially
    distinct. The three dimensions also differentially predicted interpersonal
    behaviour, social policy support, and political party support. It is argued
    that conceptualizing and measuring RWA as a set of three related ideological
    attitude dimensions may better explain complex sociopolitical phenomena than
    the currently dominant unidimensional personality based model.

  abstract: >-
    In this article, I examine the knowledge politics around pesticides in the
    United States and the role it plays in honey bee declines. Since 2006, US
    beekeepers have lost an average of one-third of their colonies each year.
    Though a number of factors influence bee health, beekeepers, researchers and
    policymakers cite pesticides as a primary contributor. In the US, pesticide
    registration is overseen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
    with the required tests conducted by chemical companies applying for
    registration. Until 2016, the EPA only required chemical companies to
    measure acute toxicity for non-target species, which means that many
    pesticides with sublethal toxicities are not labeled bee-toxic, and farmers
    can apply them without penalty while bees are on their farms or orchards. In
    addition, California state and county regulators will typically only
    investigate a bee kill caused by a labeled bee-toxic pesticide, and so
    emergent data on non-labeled, sublethal pesticides goes uncollected. These
    gaps in data collection frustrate beekeepers and disincentivize them from
    reporting colony losses to regulatory agencies – thus reinforcing ignorance
    about which chemicals are toxic to bees. I term the iterative cycle of
    non-knowledge co-constituted by regulatory shortfalls and stakeholder
    regulatory disengagement an ‘ignorance loop’. I conclude with a discussion
    of what this dynamic can tell us about the politics of knowledge production
    and pesticide governance and the consequences of ‘ignorance loops’ for
    stakeholders and the environment.

  abstract: >-
    Scientists who perform environmental research on policy-relevant topics face
    challenges when communicating about how values may have influenced their
    research. This study examines how citizens view scientists who publicly
    acknowledge values. Specifically, we investigate whether it matters: if
    citizens share or oppose a scientist’s values, if a scientist’s conclusions
    seem contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and if a
    scientist is assessing the state of the science or making a policy
    recommendation. We conducted two 3x2 factorial design online experiments.
    Experiment 1 featured a hypothetical scientist assessing the state of the
    science on the public-health effects of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), and
    Experiment 2 featured a scientist making a policy recommendation on use of
    BPA. We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and
    whether the scientist’s conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with
    the scientist’s values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects’ values
    aligned with the scientist’s values. We analyzed our data with ordinary
    least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least
    preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived
    credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs
    depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether
    scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether
    scientists make policy recommendations.

    The primary tension in public discourse about the U.S. government’s response
    to the coronavirus pandemic has been President Trump’s disagreement with
    scientists. The authors analyze a national survey of 1,593 Americans to
    examine which social groups agree with scientists’ ability to understand the
    novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and which agree that COVID-19 scientists share
    their values. Republicans and independents are less trusting than Democrats
    on both measures, as are African Americans. The authors find conservative
    Protestants and Catholics to be skeptical of scientists’ knowledge but not
    their values. Working-class men and those who live outside cities believe in
    scientists’ knowledge but do not think they share scientists’ values. There
    is little evidence for a direct effect of President Trump’s criticism of
    scientists. The authors discuss the pragmatic implications for scientists
    trying to remain influential in COVID-19 policy.

  abstract: >-
    Philosophers of science have argued that epistemic diversity is an asset for
    the production of scientific knowledge, guarding against the effects of
    biases, among other advantages. The growing privatization of scientific
    research, on the contrary, has raised important concerns for philosophers of
    science, especially with respect to the growing sources of biases in
    research that it seems to promote. Recently, Holman and Bruner (2017) have
    shown, using a modified version of Zollman (2010) social network model, that
    an industrial selection bias can emerge in a scientific community, without
    corrupting any individual scientist, if the community is epistemically
    diverse. In this paper, we examine the strength of industrial selection
    using a reinforcement learning model, which simulates the process of
    industrial decision-making when allocating funding to scientific projects.
    Contrary to Holman and Bruner’s model, in which the probability of success
    of the agents when performing an action is given a priori, in our model the
    industry learns about the success rate of individual scientists and updates
    the probability of success on each round. The results of our simulations
    show that even without previous knowledge of the probability of success of
    an individual scientist, the industry is still able to disrupt scientific
    consensus. In fact, the more epistemically diverse the scientific community,
    the easier it is for the industry to move scientific consensus to the
    opposite conclusion. Interestingly, our model also shows that having a
    random funding agent seems to effectively counteract industrial selection
    bias. Accordingly, we consider the random allocation of funding for research
    projects as a strategy to counteract industrial selection bias, avoiding
    commercial exploitation of epistemically diverse communities.

  abstract: >-
    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

  abstract: >-
    The demarcation of science from other intellectual activities-long an
    analytic problem for philosophers and sociologists-is here examined as a
    practical problem for scientists. Construction of a boundary between science
    and varieties of non-science is useful for scientists' pursuit of
    professional goals: acquisition of intellectual authority and career
    opportunities; denial of these resources to "pseudoscientists"; and
    protection of the autonomy of scientific research from political
    interference. "Boundary-work" describes an ideological style found in
    scientists' attempts to create a public image for science by contrasting it
    favorably to non-scientific intellectual or technical activities.
    Alternative sets of characteristics available for ideological attribution to
    science reflect ambivalences or strains within the institution: science can
    be made to look empirical or theoretical, pure or applied. However,
    selection of one or another description depends on which characteristics
    best achieve the demarcation in a way that justifies scientists' claims to
    authority or resources. Thus, "science" is no single thing: its boundaries
    are drawn and redrawn inflexible, historically changing and sometimes
    ambiguous ways.

  abstract: >-
    The public has voiced concern over the adverse effects of vaccines from the
    moment Dr. Edward Jenner introduced the first smallpox vaccine in 1796. The
    controversy over childhood immunization intensified in 1998, when Dr. Andrew
    Wakefield linked the MMR vaccine to autism. Although Wakefield’s findings
    were later discredited and retracted, and medical and scientific evidence
    suggests routine immunizations have significantly reduced life-threatening
    conditions like measles, whooping cough, and polio, vaccine refusal and
    vaccine-preventable outbreaks are on the rise. This book explores vaccine
    hesitancy and refusal among parents in the industrialized North. Although
    biomedical, public health, and popular science literature has focused on a
    scientifically ignorant public, the real problem, Maya J. Goldenberg argues,
    lies not in misunderstanding, but in mistrust. Public confidence in
    scientific institutions and government bodies has been shaken by fraud,
    research scandals, and misconduct. Her book reveals how vaccine studies
    sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, compelling rhetorics from the
    anti-vaccine movement, and the spread of populist knowledge on social media
    have all contributed to a public mistrust of the scientific consensus.
    Importantly, it also emphasizes how historical and current discrimination in
    health care against marginalized communities continues to shape public
    perception of institutional trustworthiness. Goldenberg ultimately reframes
    vaccine hesitancy as a crisis of public trust rather than a war on science,
    arguing that having good scientific support of vaccine efficacy and safety
    is not enough. In a fraught communications landscape, Vaccine Hesitancy
    advocates for trust-building measures that focus on relationships,
    transparency, and justice.

    Much of the literature concerning epistemic injustice has focused on the
    variety of harms done to socially marginalized persons in their capacities
    as potential contributors to knowledge projects. However, in order to
    understand the full implications of the social nature of knowing, we must
    confront the circulation of knowledge and the capacity of epistemic agents
    to take up knowledge produced by others and make use of it. I argue that
    members of socially marginalized lay communities can suffer epistemic trust
    injustices when potentially powerful forms of knowing such as scientific
    understandings are generated in isolation from them, and when the social
    conditions required for a responsibly-placed trust to be formed relative to
    the relevant epistemic institutions fail to transpire.

    Abstract
                The field of science communication is plagued by challenges. Communicators face the difficulty of responding to unjustified public skepticism over issues like climate change and COVID-19 while also acknowledging the fallibility and limitations of scientific knowledge. Our goal in this paper is to suggest a new model for science communication that can help foster more productive, respectful relationships among all those involved in science communication. Inspired by the pragmatist philosophy of John Dewey, we develop an experience model, according to which science communication consists in people’s experiences with science and the meanings they develop from those experiences. Three principles are central to the model: experience is cumulative, context matters, and audiences have agency. We argue that this model has significant implications both for communication research and practice, which we illustrate by applying it to the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. We show how science communicators can help to identify and alleviate structural factors that contribute to skepticism as well as fostering opportunities for meaning making around shared experiences.

    We present the Credibility of Science Scale (CoSS), an efficient 6-item
    scale demonstrating excellent reliability and validity. CoSS scores exhibit
    criterion validity in predicting beliefs across a host of contemporary
    science topics, over and above previously documented predictors (Study 2).
    Further, we present evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of
    the instrument, which correlates as expected with several variables
    previously implicated in scientific belief (e.g., political ideology,
    religious identity, conspiracist thinking; Study 2) and also with measures
    of cognitive ability (Study 3). Finally, we discuss possible uses of the
    CoSS as a tool for understanding sciencerelated beliefs, behavior, and
    communication.

    More than a decade of exacting scientific research involving paleontological
    fragments and ancient DNA has lately produced a series of pronouncements
    about a purportedly novel population of archaic hominins dubbed “the
    Denisova.” The science involved in these matters is both technically
    stunning and, socially, at times a bit reckless. Here I discuss the
    responsibilities which scientists incur when they make inductively risky
    pronouncements about the different relative contributions by Denisovans to
    genomes of members of apparent subpopulations of current humans (i.e., the
    so-called “races”). This science is sensational: it is science which
    empirically speculates, to the public delight’s and entertainment, about
    scintillating topics such as when humans evolved, where we came from, and
    who else we were having sex with during our early hominin history. An
    initial characterization of sensational science emerges from my discussion
    of the case, as well as a diagnosis of an interactive phenomenon termed
    amplified inductive risk.

  abstract: >-
    Children and adults differentiate statements of religious belief from
    statements of fact and opinion, but the basis of that differentiation
    remains unclear. Across three experiments, adults and 8–10-year-old children
    heard statements of factual, opinion-based, and religious belief. Adults and
    children judged that statements of factual belief revealed more about the
    world, statements of opinion revealed more about individuals, and statements
    of religious belief provided information about both. Children—unlike
    adults—judged that statements of religious belief revealed more about the
    world than the believer. These results led to three conclusions. First,
    judgments concerning the relative amount of information statements of
    religious belief provide about individuals change across development,
    perhaps because adults have more experience with diversity. Second,
    recognizing that statements of religious belief provide information about
    both the world and the believer does not require protracted learning. Third,
    statements of religious belief are interpreted as amalgams of factual and
    opinion-based statements.

  abstract: >-
    Given their lack of background knowledge, laypeople require expert help when
    dealing with scientific information. To decide whose help is dependable,
    laypeople must judge an expert’s epistemic trustworthiness in terms of
    competence, adherence to scientific standards, and good intentions. Online,
    this may be difficult due to the often limited and sometimes unreliable
    source information available. To measure laypeople’s evaluations of experts
    (encountered online), we constructed an inventory to assess epistemic
    trustworthiness on the dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence.
    Exploratory (n = 237) and confirmatory factor analyses (n = 345) showed that
    the Muenster Epistemic Trustworthiness Inventory (METI) is composed of these
    three factors. A subsequent experimental study (n = 137) showed that all
    three dimensions of the METI are sensitive to variation in source
    characteristics. We propose using this inventory to measure assignments of
    epistemic trustworthiness, that is, all judgments laypeople make when
    deciding whether to place epistemic trust in–and defer to–an expert in order
    to solve a scientific informational problem that is beyond their
    understanding.

    Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields
    (“the replication crisis”) have stimulated a movement for open science,
    encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and
    analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency
    (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule
    prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices
    are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this
    paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of
    environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science
    requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical
    evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health
    specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the
    replication crisis extends to environmental public health — or not — seem
    premature. By distinguishing three concepts — reproducibility,
    replicability, and robustness — it is clear that open data initiatives can
    promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote
    replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open
    science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the
    costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.

  abstract: >-
    While philosophers of science generally agree that social, political, and
    ethical values can play legitimate roles in science, there is active debate
    over whether scientists should disclosure such values in their public
    communications. This debate depends, in part, on empirical claims about
    whether values disclosures might undermine public trust in science. In a
    previous study, Elliott et al. used an online experiment to test this
    empirical claim. The current paper reports a replication attempt of their
    experiment. Comparing results of the original study and our replication, we
    do not find evidence for a transparency penalty or “shared values” effect,
    but do find evidence that the content of scientific conclusions (whether or
    not a chemical is found to cause harm) might effect perceived
    trustworthiness and that scientists who value public health and disclose
    this value might be perceived as more trustworthy.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

  abstract: >-
    There is now a general consensus amongst philosophers in the values in
    science literature that values necessarily play a role in core areas of
    scientific inquiry. We argue that attention should now be turned from
    debating the value-free ideal to delineating legitimate from illegitimate
    influences of values in science, a project we dub “The New Demarcation
    Problem.” First, we review past attempts to demarcate the uses of values and
    propose a categorization of the strategies by where they seek to draw
    legitimacy from. Next, we propose a set of desiderata for what we take to be
    a satisfactory solution and present a case study where conflicting sets of
    values clearly impinge on science, but where the legitimacy of their
    influence is ambiguous. We use these desiderata and the case study to
    illustrate what we take to be the strengths and weaknesses of current
    strategies. To be clear, our goal is not to answer the question we pose, but
    to articulate a framework within which a solution can be judged.

    Private companies provide by far the most funding for scientific research
    and development. Nevertheless, relatively little attention has been paid to
    the dynamics of industry-funded research by philosophers of science. This
    paper addresses this gap by providing an overview of the major strengths and
    weaknesses of industry research funding, together with the existing
    recommendations for addressing the weaknesses. It is designed to provide a
    starting point for future philosophical work that explores the features of
    industry-funded research, avenues for addressing concerns, and strategies
    for making research funded by the private sector as fruitful as possible.

  abstract: >-
    A new conceptualization and measurement of social dominance
    orientation—individual differences in the preference for group based
    hierarchy and inequality—is introduced. In contrast to previous measures of
    social dominance orientation that were designed to be unidimensional, the
    new measure (SDO7) embeds theoretically grounded subdimensions of
    SDO—SDO-Dominance (SDO-D) and SDO-Egalitarianism (SDO-E). SDO-D constitutes
    a preference for systems of group-based dominance in which high status
    groups forcefully oppress lower status groups. SDO-E constitutes a
    preference for systems of group-based inequality that are maintained by an
    interrelated network of subtle hierarchy-enhancing ideologies and social
    policies. Confirmatory factor and criterion validity analyses confirmed that
    SDO-D and SDO-E are theoretically distinct and dissociate in terms of the
    intergroup outcomes they best predict. For the first time, distinct
    personality and individual difference bases of SDO-D and SDO-E are outlined.
    We clarify the construct validity of SDO by strictly assessing a preference
    for dominance hierarchies in general, removing a possible confound relating
    to support for hierarchy benefitting the ingroup. Consistent with this,
    results show that among members of a disadvantaged ethnic minority group
    (African Americans), endorsement of SDO7 is inversely related to ingroup
    identity. We further demonstrate these effects using nationally
    representative samples of U.S. Blacks and Whites, documenting the
    generalizability of these findings. Finally, we introduce and validate a
    brief 4-item measure of each dimension. This article importantly extends our
    theoretical understanding of one of the most generative constructs in social
    psychology, and introduces powerful new tools for its measurement. (PsycInfo

  abstract: >-
    The relationship between life outcomes and an individual’s standing in the
    social and economic hierarchy of society is an important topic across the
    social sciences. Foundational to this work is assessing an individual’s
    standing in this hierarchy, often referred to as socioeconomic status (SES).
    One component of an individual’s SES, often overlooked in the psychological
    literature, is occupational prestige – the amount of status accorded to them
    based on their occupational role. In this research, we collected and
    validated a new index of occupational prestige for 1029 specific
    occupations, including all jobs in the US Department of Labor’s O*NET
    database, and 22 broader occupational families. In Study 1, we collected a
    comprehensive set of occupational prestige ratings from an online
    convenience sample, and demonstrated their high reliability. In Study 2, we
    developed a crosswalk between the ratings collected in Study 1 and prior
    ratings of occupations listed in the US Census and show convergent validity
    with previous indices. In Studies 3 and 4 we used additional data to
    evaluate the construct validity of occupational prestige more broadly. In
    Study 3, we established convergent and discriminant validity with other
    indicators of SES: income and educational attainment. In Study 4, we use the
    O*NET database to identify the characteristics of occupations most strongly
    associated with prestige. These results support the validity of the index
    and suggest occupations with high prestige require skills traditionally
    emphasized in liberal arts education (e.g., critical thinking, reading
    comprehension).

    This study examines the conflation of terms such as “knowledge” and
    “understanding” in peer-reviewed literature, and tests the hypothesis that
    little current research clearly distinguishes between importantly distinct
    epistemic states. Two sets of data are presented from papers published in
    the journal Public Understanding of Science. In the first set, the digital
    text analysis tool, Voyant, is used to analyze all papers published in 2014
    for the use of epistemic success terms. In the second set of data, all
    papers published in Public Understanding of Science from 2010–2015 are
    systematically analyzed to identify instances in which epistemic states are
    empirically measured. The results indicate that epistemic success terms are
    inconsistently defined, and that measurement of understanding, in
    particular, is rarely achieved in public understanding of science studies.
    We suggest that more diligent attention to measuring understanding, as
    opposed to mere knowledge, will increase efficacy of scientific outreach and
    communication efforts.

  abstract: >-
    While it is widely acknowledged that science is not “free” of non-epistemic
    values, there is disagreement about the roles that values can appropriately
    play. Several have argued that non-epistemic values can play important roles
    in modeling decisions, particularly in addressing uncertainties (Moss and
    Schneider 2000; Kandlikar et al. (C.R. Geoscience 337:443-455, 2005); Risbey
    2007; Biddle and Winsberg 2010; Winsberg (Kennedy Institute of Ethics
    Journal 22(2): 111-137, 2012); van der Sluijs (Climatic Change 75 (3)
    359-389, 2012). On the other hand, such values can (even unconsciously) lead
    to bias (Pielke 2007; Oppenhiemer et al. (Science 317:1505-1506, 2007); Bray
    (Environmental Science & Policy 13:340-350, 2010); Oreskes and Conway 2010).
    Thus, it is important to identify when it is legitimate to appeal to
    non-epistemic values in modeling decisions. An approach is defended here
    whereby such value judgments are legitimate when they promote democratically
    endorsed epistemological and social aims of research. This framework
    accounts for why it is legitimate to appeal to non-epistemic values in a
    range of modeling decisions, while addressing concerns that the presence of
    such values will lead to bias or give scientists disproportionate power in
    deciding what values ought to be endorsed.

    This paper describes the ‘ordinary science intelligence’ scale (OSI_2.0).
    Designed for use in the empirical study of risk perception and science
    communication, OSI_2.0 comprises items intended to measure a latent capacity
    to recognize and make use of valid scientific evidence in everyday
    decision-making. The derivation of the items, the relationship of them to
    the knowledge and skills OSI requires, and the psychometric properties of
    the scale are examined. Evidence of the external validity of OSI_2.0 is also
    presented. Finally, the utility of OSI_2.0 is briefly illustrated by its use
    to assess standard survey items on evolution and global warming: when
    administered to members of a US general population sample, these items are
    more convincingly viewed as indicators of one or another latent cultural
    identity than as indicators of science comprehension.

  abstract: >-
    The 2016 presidential election was a jarring event for polling in the United
    States. Preelection polls fueled high-profile predictions that Hillary
    Clinton’s likelihood of winning the presidency was about 90 percent, with
    estimates ranging from 71 to over 99 percent. When Donald Trump was declared
    the winner of the presidency, there was a widespread perception that the
    polls failed. But did the polls fail? And if so, why? Those are among the
    central questions addressed by an American Association for Public Opinion
    Research (AAPOR) ad hoc committee. This paper presents the committee’s
    analysis of the performance of preelection polls in 2016, how that
    performance compares to polling in prior elections, and the extent to which
    performance varied by poll design. In addition, the committee examined
    several theories as to why many polls, particularly in the Upper Midwest,
    underestimated support for Trump. The explanations for which the most
    evidence exists are a late swing in vote preference toward Trump and a
    pervasive failure to adjust for overrepresentation of college graduates (who
    favored Clinton). In addition, there is clear evidence that voter turnout
    changed from 2012 to 2016 in ways that favored Trump, though there is only
    mixed evidence that misspecified likely voter models were a major cause of
    the systematic polling error. Finally, there is little evidence that
    socially desirable (Shy Trump) responding was an important contributor to
    poll error.

  abstract: >-
    Social scientists have offered a number of explanations for why Americans
    commonly deny that human-caused climate change is real. In this paper, I
    argue that these explanations neglect an important group of climate change
    deniers: those who say they are on the side of science while also rejecting
    what they know most climate scientists accept. I then develop a “nature of
    science” hypothesis that does account for this group of deniers. According
    to this hypothesis, people have serious misconceptions about what scientific
    inquiry ought to look like. Their misconceptions interact with partisan
    biases to produce denial of human-caused climate change. After I develop
    this hypothesis, I propose ways of confirming that it is true. Then I
    consider its implications for efforts to combat climate change denial and
    for other cases of public rejection of science.

  abstract: >-
    Events such as the 2017 “March for Science” have brought greater attention
    to public attitudes toward science and scientists. Our analyses of recent
    poll data show that Americans’ confidence in scientists has been high for
    roughly 40 years (relative to other institutions), and that it is high even
    for controversial topics such as global warming and nuclear energy.
    International comparisons show broad similarities with individuals in
    Germany and the UK, including that trust in scientists can fluctuate
    depending on who employs them and what topic is under discussion. Finally,
    more granular analyses in the United States reveal large divides in trust
    based on geographic location and religious identification (i.e., rural
    residents exhibit comparatively low trust and the nonreligious comparatively
    high trust), while the gap between political partisans has been relatively
    small but has spiked in recent years.

  abstract: >-
    Since 1990, the number of mandated vaccines has increased dramatically.
    Today, a fully vaccinated child will have received nearly three dozen
    vaccinations between birth and age six. Along with the increase in number
    has come a growing wave of concern among parents about the unintended side
    effects of vaccines. In Vaccine, Mark A. Largent explains the history of the
    debate and identifies issues that parents, pediatricians, politicians, and
    public health officials must address.Nearly 40% of American parents report
    that they delay or refuse a recommended vaccine for their children. Despite
    assurances from every mainstream scientific and medical institution, parents
    continue to be haunted by the question of whether vaccines cause autism. In
    response, health officials herald vaccines as both safe and vital to the
    public's health and put programs and regulations in place to encourage
    parents to follow the recommended vaccine schedule.For Largent, the
    vaccine-autism debate obscures a constellation of concerns held by many
    parents, including anxiety about the number of vaccines required (including
    some for diseases that children are unlikely ever to encounter), unhappiness
    about the rigorous schedule of vaccines during well-baby visits, and fear of
    potential side effects, some of them serious and even life-threatening. This
    book disentangles competing claims, opens the controversy for critical
    reflection, and provides recommendations for moving forward.

  abstract: >-
    Research has documented the decline of trust in science among Republicans,
    ideological conservatives, and fundamentalist religious groups. However,
    less is known about the nature of party polarization in these trends: did
    polarization only increase because of changes among Republicans? In this
    study, the author tests a two-sided polarization thesis using data from the
    General Social Survey (1974–2018). The findings show that a significant
    share of the growth in party polarization is due to an increase of trust in
    science among Democrats. In fact, by the 2010s, Democrats became
    significantly more likely than either Republicans or independents to have
    high confidence in science. Moreover, the results also show that the
    aggregate party-level changes are driven largely by trends among
    conservative Republicans, moderate Democrats, and liberal Democrats.
    Together, these findings have implications for our understanding of the
    nature and potential causes of partisan polarization in beliefs about the
    cultural authority of science.

  abstract: >-
    The emphasis on the limitations of objectivity, in specific guises and
    networks, has been a continuing theme of contemporary analytic philosophy
    for the past few decades. The popular sport of baiting feminist philosophers
    -- into pointing to what's left out of objective knowledge, or into
    describing what methods, exactly, they would offer to replace the powerful
    "objective" methods grounding scientific knowledge -- embodies a blatant
    double standard which has the effect of constantly putting feminist
    epistemologists on the defensive, on the fringes, on the run. This strategy
    can only work if 'objectivity' is transparent, simple, stable, and clear in
    its meaning. It most certainly is not. In fact, taking 'objectivity' as a
    sort of beautiful primitive, self-evident in its value, and all-powerful in
    its revelatory power, requires careless philosophy, and the best workers in
    metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of science have made reworked
    definitions of 'objectivity' absolutely central to their own projects. In
    fact, classic feminist concerns with exploring the impact of sex and gender
    on knowledge, understanding, and other relations between human beings and
    the rest of the world fall squarely within the sort of human and social
    settings that are already considered central in most current analytic
    metaphysics, episteomology, and philosophy of science. I argue that the
    burden of proof is clearly on those who wish to reject the centrality and
    relevance of sex and gender to our most fundamental philosophical work on
    knowledge and reality.

  abstract: >-
    Many students reject evolutionary theory, whether or not they adequately
    understand basic evolutionary concepts. We explore the hypothesis that
    accepting evolution is related to understanding the nature of science. In
    particular, students may be more likely to accept evolution if they
    understand that a scientific theory is provisional but reliable, that
    scientists employ diverse methods for testing scientific claims, and that
    relating data to theory can require inference and interpretation. In a study
    with university undergraduates, we find that accepting evolution is
    significantly correlated with understanding the nature of science, even when
    controlling for the effects of general interest in science and past science
    education. These results highlight the importance of understanding the
    nature of science for accepting evolution. We conclude with a discussion of
    key characteristics of science that challenge a simple portrayal of the
    scientific method and that we believe should be emphasized in classrooms.

    Compute marginal effects and adjusted predictions from statistical models
    and returns the result as tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to
    use with the 'ggplot2'-package. Effects and predictions can be calculated
    for many different models. Interaction terms, splines and polynomial terms
    are also supported. The main functions are ggpredict(), ggemmeans() and
    ggeffect(). There is a generic plot()-method to plot the results using
    'ggplot2'.

    Scientism proposes science to be an all-powerful human enterprise, able to
    answer not only all practical but also philosophical or moral questions. We
    are taking a psychological approach to scientism, studying uncritical trust
    in science and uncritical trust in scientists as a part of a unique
    attitudinal tendency. Our novel measure assesses both kinds of trust through
    short Thurstone scales allowing us to establish a clear threshold for
    endorsing scientism, thus effectively delineating it from science
    enthusiasm, which previous instruments were unable to do. We built and
    refined a novel scale through five stages in which we consulted relevant
    literature, experts, and laypeople. We demonstrated that uncritical trust in
    science and scientists are interrelated, yet distinct constructs. As
    expected, these two subscales positively correlated with dogmatism,
    scientific knowledge, and overclaiming, but not with knowledge
    overestimation. The results suggest the new instrument is reliable, valid,
    and suitable for the lay public.

    In recent years, many questions have been raised about whether public
    confidence in science is changing. To clarify recent trends in the public’s
    confidence and factors that are associated with these feelings, an effort
    initiated by the National Academies’ Strategic Council for Research
    Excellence, Integrity, and Trust (the Strategic Council) analyzed findings
    from multiple survey research organizations. The Strategic Council’s effort,
    which began in 2022, found that U.S. public confidence in science, the
    scientific community, and leaders of scientific communities is high relative
    to other civic, cultural, and governmental institutions for which
    researchers regularly collect such data. However, confidence in these
    institutions has fallen during the previous 5 years. Science’s decline,
    while real, is similar to or less than that in the other groups. A recent
    study goes into greater detail by exploring public views of science. From
    these data, we observe that many of the surveyed U.S. public question the
    extent to which scientists share their values or overcome personal biases
    when presenting conclusions. At the same time, large majorities agree on
    certain types of actions that they want scientists to take. For example, 84%
    respond that it is “somewhat important” or “very important” for scientists
    to disclose their funders. Ninety-two percent (92%) offer the same responses
    to scientists “being open to changing their minds based on new evidence.”
    Collectively, these data clarify how the U.S. public views science and
    scientists. They also suggest actions that can affect public confidence in
    science and scientists in the years to come.

  abstract: >-
    Philosophers now commonly reject the value free ideal for science by arguing
    that non-epistemic values, including personal or social values, are
    permissible within the core of scientific research. However, little
    attention has been paid to the normative political consequences of this
    position. This paper explores these consequences and shows how political
    theory is fruitful for proceeding in a world without value-neutral science.
    I draw attention to an oft-overlooked argument employed by proponents of the
    value free ideal I dub the “political legitimacy argument.” This argument
    claims that the value-free ideal follows directly from the foundational
    principles of liberal democracy. If so, then the use of value-laden
    scientific information within democratic decision making would be
    illegitimate on purely political grounds. Despite highlighting this
    unaddressed and important argument, I show how it can be rejected. By
    appealing to deliberative democratic theory, I demonstrate scientific
    information can be value-laden and politically legitimate. The deliberative
    democratic account I develop is well suited for capturing the intuitions of
    many opponents of the value free ideal and points to a new set of questions
    for those interested in values in science.

    As part of Springer 's series on feminist philosophy, Feminist Epistemology
    and Philosophy of Science: Power in Knowledge collects exciting new works
    that address today 's key challenges for a feminist approach to knowledge
    and scientific practice. With the relative dearth of collected volumes on
    the topic in the last decade, this volume will be of interest to both
    students and scholars of feminist epistemology and philosophy of science. It
    offers a mix of new contributions from well-established feminist scholars
    and the next generation of feminist epistemologists.

  abstract: >-
    The lack of public support for climate change policies and refusals to
    vaccinate children are just two alarming illustrations of the impacts of
    dissent about scientific claims. Dissent can lead to confusion, false
    beliefs, and widespread public doubt about highly justified scientific
    evidence. Even more dangerously, it has begun to corrode the very authority
    of scientific consensus and knowledge. Deployed aggressively and to
    political ends, some dissent can intimidate scientists, stymie research, and
    lead both the public and policymakers to oppose important public policies
    firmly rooted in science. To criticize dissent is, however, a fraught
    exercise. Skepticism and fearless debate are key to the scientific process,
    making it both vital and incredibly difficult to characterize and identify
    dissent that is problematic in its approach and consequences. Indeed, as de
    Melo-Martín and Intemann show, the criteria commonly proposed as means of
    identifying inappropriate dissent are flawed and the strategies generally
    recommended to tackle such dissent are not only ineffective but could even
    make the situation worse. The Fight Against Doubt proposes that progress on
    this front can best be achieved by enhancing the trustworthiness of the
    scientific community and by being more realistic about the limits of science
    when it comes to policymaking. It shows that a richer understanding of the
    context in which science operates is needed to disarm problematic dissent
    and those who deploy it. This, the authors argue, is the best way forward,
    rather than diagnosing the many instances of wrong-headed dissent.

  abstract: >-
    The value-free ideal in science has been criticised as both unattainable and
    undesirable. We argue that it can be defended as a practical principle
    guiding scientific research even if the unattainability and undesirability
    of a value-free end-state are granted. If a goal is unattainable, then one
    can separate the desirability of accomplishing the goal from the
    desirability of pursuing it. We articulate a novel value-free ideal, which
    holds that scientists should act as if science should be value-free, and we
    argue that even if a purely value-free science is undesirable, this
    value-free ideal is desirable to pursue.

  abstract: >-
    A notable feature in the public framing of debates involving the science of
    Anthropogenic Global Warming are appeals to uncritical ‘positivist’ images
    of the ideal scientific method. Versions of Sir Karl Popper’s philosophy of
    falsification appear most frequently, featuring in many Web sites and
    broader media. This use of pop philosophy of science forms part of
    strategies used by critics, mainly from conservative political backgrounds,
    to manufacture doubt, by setting unrealistic standards for sound science, in
    the veracity of science of Anthropogenic Global Warming. It will be shown,
    nevertheless, that prominent supporters of Anthropogenic Global Warming
    science also often use similar references to Popper to support their claims.
    It will also be suggested that this pattern reflects longer traditions of
    the use of Popperian philosophy of science in controversial settings,
    particularly in the United States, where appeals to the authority of science
    to legitimize policy have been most common. It will be concluded that
    studies of the science of Anthropogenic Global Warming debate would benefit
    from taking greater interest in questions raised by un-reflexive and
    politically expedient public understanding(s) of the philosophy of science
    of both critics and supporters of the science of Anthropogenic Global
    Warming.

  abstract: >-
    This paper deals with the nature of trust in science. Understanding what
    appropriate trust in science is and why it can reasonably break down is
    important for improving scientists’ trustworthiness. There are two different
    ways in which philosophers of science think about trust in science: as based
    on objectivity or as based on shared values. Some authors argue that
    objectivity actually grounds mere reliance, not genuine trust. They draw on
    a distinction that philosophers of trust following Annette Baier have made
    with respect to interpersonal trust, where genuine trust has some normative
    element to it that is missing in cases of mere reliance. However, I will
    show that there are plural forms of trust in science: Both objectivity and
    shared values ground trust in science in a normative sense. I will link the
    trust in science debate to the literature on interpersonal trust. This is
    significant in that, beyond references to Baier, there is little connection
    between both areas of philosophy. In a pluralist reading, different trust
    accounts help to identify the normative elements involved in different kinds
    of trust in science.

    Few people, if any, still argue that science in all its aspects is a
    value-free endeavor. At the very least, values affect decisions about the
    choice of research problems to investigate and the uses to which the results
    of research are applied. But what about the actual doing of science? As
    Science, Values, and Objectivityreveals, the connections and interactions
    between values and science are quite complex. The essays in this volume
    identify the crucial values that play a role in science, distinguish some of
    the criteria that can be used for value identification, and elaborate the
    conditions for warranting certain values as necessary or central to the very
    activity of scientific research. Recently, social constructivists have taken
    the presence of values within the scientific model to question the basis of
    objectivity. However, the contributors to Science, Values, and Objectivity
    recognize that such acknowledgment of the role of values does not negate the
    fact that objects exist in the world. Objects have the power to constrain
    our actions and thoughts, though the norms for these thoughts lie in the
    public, social world. Values may be decried or defended, praised or blamed,
    but in a world that strives for a modicum of reason, values, too, must be
    reasoned. Critical assessment of the values that play a role in scientific
    research is as much a part of doing good science as interpreting data.

    In their attempt to defend philosophy from accusations of uselessness made
    by prominent scientists, such as Stephen Hawking, some philosophers respond
    with the charge of ‘scientism.’ This charge makes endorsing a scientistic
    stance, a mistake by definition. For this reason, it begs the question
    against these critics of philosophy, or anyone who is inclined to endorse a
    scientistic stance, and turns the scientism debate into a verbal dispute. In
    this paper, I propose a different definition of scientism, and thus a new
    way of looking at the scientism debate. Those philosophers who seek to
    defend philosophy against accusations of uselessness would do philosophy a
    much better service, I submit, if they were to engage with the definition of
    scientism put forth in this paper, rather than simply make it analytic that
    scientism is a mistake.

    Abstract
                What should citizens understand about science to participate in democratic life? Against the prevailing approach, we argue that “what” a public understanding of science is about strongly depends on the specific epistemological nature of the science related issues considered in different contexts and circumstances. We identify three specific categories of such issues and show how, equally, specific models of public understanding are required to address them. Only by endorsing such an alternative approach will citizens arguably be able to form sound opinions about those very issues, as well as to discuss and deliberate rationally about them.

  abstract: >-
    The scientific consensus on human-caused global warming has been a topic of
    intense interest in recent decades. This is in part due to the important
    role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts
    on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies,
    using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have
    quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90% and 100% agreement
    on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97%
    agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years
    after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define
    expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929
    invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of
    geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and
    received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we
    independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts
    published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their
    survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary
    approach classifying someone as ‘expert’ or ‘non-expert’, we also look at
    expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming
    is high (91% to 100%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group
    of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7% of those scientists
    indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity
    such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of
    expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+
    peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100%
    agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.

  abstract: >-
    Trust in science and scientists can greatly influence consideration of
    scientific developments and activities. Yet, trust is a nebulous construct
    based on emotions, knowledge, beliefs, and relationships. As we explored the
    literature regarding trust in science and scientists we discovered that no
    instruments were available to assess the construct, and therefore, we
    developed one. Using a process of data collection from science faculty
    members and undergraduate students, field testing, expert feedback, and an
    iterative process of design, we developed, validated, and established the
    reliability of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory. Our 21-item
    instrument has a reliability of Cronbach's alpha of .86, and we have
    successfully field-tested it with a range of undergraduate college students.
    We discuss implications and possible applications of the instrument, and
    include it in the appendix.

  abstract: >-
    Parents in the US and other societies are increasingly refusing to vaccinate
    their children, even though popular anti-vaccine myths – e.g. ‘vaccines
    cause autism’ – have been debunked. This book explains the epistemic and
    moral failures that lead some parents to refuse to vaccinate their children.
    First, some parents have good reasons not to defer to the expertise of
    physicians, and to rely instead upon their own judgments about how to care
    for their children. Unfortunately, epistemic self-reliance systematically
    distorts beliefs in areas of inquiry in which expertise is required (like
    vaccine immunology). Second, vaccine refusers and mainstream medical
    authorities are often committed to different values surrounding health and
    safety. For example, while vaccine advocates stress that vaccines have low
    rates of serious complications, vaccine refusers often resist vaccination
    because it is ‘unnatural’ and because they view vaccine-preventable diseases
    as a ‘natural’ part of childhood. Finally, parents who refuse vaccines
    rightly resist the utilitarian moral arguments – ‘for the greater good’ –
    that vaccine advocates sometimes make. Unfortunately, vaccine refusers also
    sometimes embrace a pernicious hyper-individualism that sanctions
    free-riding on herd immunity and that cultivates indifference to the
    interpersonal and social harms that unvaccinated persons may cause.

  abstract: >-
    Between its founding in 1966 and its formal end in 1980, the Black Panther
    Party blazed a distinctive trail in American political culture. The Black
    Panthers are most often remembered for their revolutionary rhetoric and
    militant action. Here Alondra Nelson deftly recovers an indispensable but
    lesser-known aspect of the organization’s broader struggle for social
    justice: health care. The Black Panther Party’s health activism—its network
    of free health clinics, its campaign to raise awareness about genetic
    disease, and its challenges to medical discrimination—was an expression of
    its founding political philosophy and also a recognition that poor blacks
    were both underserved by mainstream medicine and overexposed to its harms.
    Drawing on extensive historical research as well as interviews with former
    members of the Black Panther Party, Nelson argues that the Party’s focus on
    health care was both practical and ideological. Building on a long tradition
    of medical self-sufficiency among African Americans, the Panthers’ People’s
    Free Medical Clinics administered basic preventive care, tested for lead
    poisoning and hypertension, and helped with housing, employment, and social
    services. In 1971, the party launched a campaign to address sickle-cell
    anemia. In addition to establishing screening programs and educational
    outreach efforts, it exposed the racial biases of the medical system that
    had largely ignored sickle-cell anemia, a disease that predominantly
    affected people of African descent. The Black Panther Party’s understanding
    of health as a basic human right and its engagement with the social
    implications of genetics anticipated current debates about the politics of
    health and race. That legacy—and that struggle—continues today in the
    commitment of health activists and the fight for universal health care.

  abstract: >-
    Given the central importance of the Nature of Science (NOS) and Scientific
    Inquiry (SI) in national and international science standards and science
    learning, empirical support for the theoretical delineation of these
    constructs is of considerable significance. Furthermore, tests of the
    effects of varying magnitudes of NOS knowledge on domain‐specific science
    understanding and belief require the application of instruments validated in
    accordance with AERA, APA, and NCME assessment standards. Our study explores
    three interrelated aspects of a recently developed NOS instrument: (1)
    validity and reliability; (2) instrument dimensionality; and (3) item
    scales, properties, and qualities within the context of Classical Test
    Theory and Item Response Theory (Rasch modeling). A construct analysis
    revealed that the instrument did not match published operationalizations of
    NOS concepts. Rasch analysis of the original instrument—as well as a reduced
    item set—indicated that a two‐dimensional Rasch model fit significantly
    better than a one‐dimensional model in both cases. Thus, our study revealed
    that NOS and SI are supported as two separate dimensions, corroborating
    theoretical distinctions in the literature. To identify items with
    unacceptable fit values, item quality analyses were used. A Wright Map
    revealed that few items sufficiently distinguished high performers in the
    sample and excessive numbers of items were present at the low end of the
    performance scale. Overall, our study outlines an approach for how Rasch
    modeling may be used to evaluate and improve Likert‐type instruments in
    science education.

    The social dynamics of "alternative facts": why what you believe depends on
    who you know  Why should we care about having true beliefs? And why do
    demonstrably false beliefs persist and spread despite bad, even fatal,
    consequences for the people who hold them?  Philosophers of science Cailin
    O'Connor and James Weatherall argue that social factors, rather than
    individual psychology, are what's essential to understanding the spread and
    persistence of false beliefs. It might seem that there's an obvious reason
    that true beliefs matter: false beliefs will hurt you. But if that's right,
    then why is it (apparently) irrelevant to many people whether they believe
    true things or not?  The Misinformation Age, written for a political era
    riven by "fake news," "alternative facts," and disputes over the validity of
    everything from climate change to the size of inauguration crowds, shows
    convincingly that what you believe depends on who you know. If social forces
    explain the persistence of false belief, we must understand how those forces
    work in order to fight misinformation effectively.

  abstract: >-
    Despite the wide application of the label “populist” in the 2016 election
    cycle, there has been little systematic evidence that this election is
    distinctive in its populist appeal. Looking at historical trends,
    contemporary rhetoric, and public opinion data, we find that populism is an
    appropriate descriptor of the 2016 election and that Donald Trump stands out
    in particular as the populist par excellence. Historical data reveal a large
    “representation gap” that typically accompanies populist candidates. Content
    analysis of campaign speeches shows that Trump, more so than any other
    candidate, employs a rhetoric that is distinctive in its simplicity,
    anti-elitism, and collectivism. Original survey data show that Trump’s
    supporters are distinctive in their unique combination of anti-expertise,
    anti-elitism, and pronationalist sentiments. Together, these findings
    highlight the distinctiveness of populism as a mechanism of political
    mobilization and the unusual character of the 2016 race.

    The U.S. scientific community has long led the world in research on such
    areas as public health, environmental science, and issues affecting quality
    of life. These scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of
    DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a
    small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial
    of these dangers.Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit
    group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep
    connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the
    public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades.
    Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures
    who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied
    the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid
    rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole. "Doubt is our product," wrote one tobacco
    executive. These "experts" supplied it. Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway,
    historians of science, roll back the rug on this dark corner of the American
    scientific community, showing how ideology and corporate interests, aided by
    a too-compliant media, have skewed public understanding of some of the most
    pressing issues of our era.

    Why the social character of scientific knowledge makes it trustworthyAre
    doctors right when they tell us vaccines are safe? Should we take climate
    experts at their word when they warn us about the perils of global warming?
    Why should we trust science when so many of our political leaders don't?
    Naomi Oreskes offers a bold and compelling defense of science, revealing why
    the social character of scientific knowledge is its greatest strength—and
    the greatest reason we can trust it. Tracing the history and philosophy of
    science from the late nineteenth century to today, this timely and
    provocative book features a new preface by Oreskes and critical responses by
    climate experts Ottmar Edenhofer and Martin Kowarsch, political scientist
    Jon Krosnick, philosopher of science Marc Lange, and science historian Susan
    Lindee, as well as a foreword by political theorist Stephen Macedo.

  abstract: >-
    Winner of the 2015 Rachel Carson Prize presented by the Society for Social
    Studies of ScienceResidentsof a small Louisiana town were sure that the oil
    refinery next door wasmaking them sick. As part of a campaign demanding
    relocation away from therefinery, they collected scientific data to prove
    it. Their campaign ended witha settlement agreement that addressed many of
    their grievances—but not concernsabout their health. Yet, instead of
    continuing to collect data, residents beganto let refinery scientists'
    assertions that their operations did notharm them stand without challenge.
    What makes a community moveso suddenly from actively challenging to
    apparently accepting experts'authority?RefiningExpertise arguesthat the
    answer lies in the way that refinery scientists and engineers
    definedthemselves as experts. Rather than claiming to be infallible, they
    beganto portray themselves as responsible—committed to operating safelyand
    to contributing to the well-being of the community. The volume showsthat by
    grounding their claims to responsibility in influential ideas fromthe larger
    culture about what makes good citizens, nice communities, and
    moralcompanies, refinery scientists made it much harder for residents to
    challengetheir expertise and thus re-established their authority over
    scientificquestions related to the refinery's health and environmental
    effects.GwenOttinger here shows how industrial facilities' current
    approaches todealing with concerned communities—approaches which leave much
    room fornegotiation while shielding industry's environmental and health
    claims fromcritique—effectively undermine not only individual grassroots
    campaigns butalso environmental justice activism and far-reaching effortsto
    democratize science. This work drives home the need for both activistsand
    politically engaged scholars to reconfigure their own activities inresponse,
    in order to advance community health and robust scientific knowledgeabout
    it.

  abstract: >-
    Issues with correlation attenuation due to measurement error are well
    documented. More than a century ago, Spearman proposed a correction for
    attenuation. However, this correction has seen very little use since it can
    potentially inflate the true correlation beyond one. In addition, very
    little confidence interval (CI) research has been done for correction for
    attenuation. In the present study, the authors propose a bootstrap procedure
    for estimating the deattenuated correlation and corresponding CIs. The
    authors use Monte Carlo simulations to generate data under certain
    conditions and assess the performance of the bootstrapped deattenuated
    correlation. The authors investigate for bias and 95% CI coverage. Results
    indicate that the bootstrap deattenuated correlation provided adequate
    percentile CI coverage in all but three conditions. The bias-corrected and
    accelerated CI, however, provided adequate coverage under all simulation
    conditions.

    as an argument to foster climate policy. Recent efforts to communicate such
    scientific consensus attained a high public profile but it is doubtful if
    they can be regarded successful. We argue that repeated efforts to shore up
    the scientific consensus on minimalist claims such as “humans cause global
    warming” are distractions from more urgent matters of knowledge, values,
    policy framing and public engagement. Such efforts to force policy progress
    through communicating scientific consensus misunderstand the relationship
    between scientific knowledge, publics and policymakers. More important is to
    focus on genuinely controversial issues within climate policy debates where
    expertise might play a facilitating role. Mobilizing expertise in policy
    debates calls for judgment, context and attention to diversity, rather than
    deferring to formal quantifications of narrowly scientific claims.

    We examine key aspects of data quality for online behavioral research
    between selected platforms (Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, and
    Prolific) and panels (Qualtrics and Dynata). To identify the key aspects of
    data quality, we first engaged with the behavioral research community to
    discover which aspects are most critical to researchers and found that these
    include attention, comprehension, honesty, and reliability. We then explored
    differences in these data quality aspects in two studies (N ~ 4000), with or
    without data quality filters (approval ratings). We found considerable
    differences between the sites, especially in comprehension, attention, and
    dishonesty. In Study 1 (without filters), we found that only Prolific
    provided high data quality on all measures. In Study 2 (with filters), we
    found high data quality among CloudResearch and Prolific. MTurk showed
    alarmingly low data quality even with data quality filters. We also found
    that while reputation (approval rating) did not predict data quality,
    frequency and purpose of usage did, especially on MTurk: the lowest data
    quality came from MTurk participants who report using the site as their main
    source of income but spend few hours on it per week. We provide a framework
    for future investigation into the ever-changing nature of data quality in
    online research, and how the evolving set of platforms and panels performs
    on these key aspects.

    There is increasing attention to the centrality of idealization in science.
    One common view is that models and other idealized representations are
    important to science, but that they fall short in one or more ways. On this
    view, there must be an intermediary step between idealized representation
    and the traditional aims of science, including truth, explanation, and
    prediction. Here I develop an alternative interpretation of the relationship
    between idealized representation and the aims of science. I suggest that
    continuing, widespread idealization calls into question the idea that
    science aims for truth. If instead science aims to produce understanding,
    this would enable idealizations to directly contribute to science's
    epistemic success. I also use the fact of widespread idealization to
    motivate the idea that science's wide variety aims, epistemic and
    non-epistemic, are best served by different kinds of scientific products.
    Finally, I show how these diverse aims—most rather distant from truth—result
    in the expanded influence of social values on science.

    Science is the study of our world, as it is in its messy reality.
    Nonetheless, science requires idealization to function—if we are to attempt
    to understand the world, we have to find ways to reduce its complexity. 
    Idealization and the Aims of Science shows just how crucial idealization is
    to science and why it matters. Beginning with the acknowledgment of our
    status as limited human agents trying to make sense of an exceedingly
    complex world, Angela Potochnik moves on to explain how science aims to
    depict and make use of causal patterns—a project that makes essential use of
    idealization. She offers case studies from a number of branches of science
    to demonstrate the ubiquity of idealization, shows how causal patterns are
    used to develop scientific explanations, and describes how the necessarily
    imperfect connection between science and truth leads to researchers’ values
    influencing their findings. The resulting book is a tour de force, a
    synthesis of the study of idealization that also offers countless new
    insights and avenues for future exploration.

    The cigarette is the deadliest artifact in the history of human
    civilization. It is also one of the most beguiling, thanks to more than a
    century of manipulation at the hands of tobacco industry chemists. In Golden
    Holocaust, Robert N. Proctor draws on reams of formerly-secret industry
    documents to explore how the cigarette came to be the most widely-used drug
    on the planet, with six trillion sticks sold per year. He paints a harrowing
    picture of tobacco manufacturers conspiring to block the recognition of
    tobacco-cancer hazards, even as they ensnare legions of scientists and
    politicians in a web of denial. Proctor tells heretofore untold stories of
    fraud and subterfuge, and he makes the strongest case to date for a simple
    yet ambitious remedy: a ban on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes.

    A general purpose toolbox developed originally for personality, psychometric
    theory and experimental psychology. Functions are primarily for multivariate
    analysis and scale construction using factor analysis, principal component
    analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide
    basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done using factor
    analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric correlations. Functions for analyzing
    data at multiple levels include within and between group statistics,
    including correlations and factor analysis. Validation and cross validation
    of scales developed using basic machine learning algorithms are provided, as
    are functions for simulating and testing particular item and test
    structures. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural
    equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams, including mediation
    models, factor analysis and structural equation models are created using
    basic graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book on
    psychometric theory as well as publications in personality research. For
    more information, see the <https://personality-project.org/r/> web page.

    “Follow the science” became the mantra for responding to COVID-19 pandemic.
    However, for the public this also meant “follow the scientists”, and this
    led to uneasiness as some viewed scientists as not credible. We investigate
    how beliefs about the way scientists develop their findings affect
    pandemic-related views. Our analysis shows that beliefs about scientists'
    objectivity predict views regrading coronavirus-related risks, behavioral
    changes, and policy priorities. While political party identity also predicts
    views about COVID-19-related concerns, these vary by political leaders whose
    approaches embraced versus dismissed science-based strategies, highlighting
    the importance of perceptions of scientists in shaping pandemic-related
    attitudes and beliefs.

    Despite decades of concerted efforts to communicate to the public on
    important scientific issues pertaining to the environment and public health,
    gaps between public acceptance and the scientific consensus on these issues
    remain stubborn. One strategy for dealing with this shortcoming has been to
    focus on the existence of scientific consensus on the relevant matters.
    Recent science communication research has added support to this general
    idea, though the interpretation of these studies and their generalizability
    remains a matter of contention. In this paper, we describe results of a
    qualitative interview study on different models of scientific consensus and
    the relationship between such models and trust of science, finding that
    familiarity with scientific consensus is rarer than might be expected. These
    results suggest that consensus messaging strategies may not be effective.

  abstract: >-
    Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing
    raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often
    involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding,
    transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only
    one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which
    involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively
    processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios.
    Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and
    political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be
    misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A
    multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change
    because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to
    which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.

    Richard Rudner famously argues that the communication of scientific advice
    to policy makers involves ethical value judgments. His argument has,
    however, been rightly criticized. This article revives Rudner’s conclusion,
    by strengthening both his lines of argument: we generalize his initial
    assumption regarding the form in which scientists must communicate their
    results and complete his ‘backup’ argument by appealing to the difference
    between private and public decisions. Our conclusion that science advisors
    must, for deep-seated pragmatic reasons, make value judgments is further
    bolstered by reflections on how the scientific contribution to policy is far
    less straightforward than the Rudner-style model suggests.

  abstract: >-
    A pessimistic strain of thought is fomenting in the health studies
    literature regarding the status of medicine. Ioannidis’s (2005) now famous
    finding that “most published research findings are false” and Stegenga’s
    (2018) book-length argument for medical nihilism are examples of this. In
    this paper, we argue that these positions are incorrect insofar as they rest
    on an untenable account of the nature of facts. Proper attention to
    fallibilism and the social organization of knowledge, as well as Bayesian
    probabilities in medical reasoning, prompt us to ask why the cynics expect
    the results of quantitative studies to be incontrovertibly true in the first
    place. While we agree with Ioannidis and others’ identified flaws in the
    medical research enterprise, and encourage rectification, we conclude that
    medical nihilism is not the natural outcome of the current state of
    research.

    Communicating the scientific consensus that human-caused climate change is
    real increases climate change beliefs, worry and support for public action
    in the United States. In this preregistered experiment, we tested two
    scientific consensus messages, a classic message on the reality of
    human-caused climate change and an updated message additionally emphasizing
    scientific agreement that climate change is a crisis. Across online
    convenience samples from 27 countries (n = 10,527), the classic message
    substantially reduces misperceptions (d = 0.47, 95% CI (0.41, 0.52)) and
    slightly increases climate change beliefs (from d = 0.06, 95% CI (0.01,
    0.11) to d = 0.10, 95% CI (0.04, 0.15)) and worry (d = 0.05, 95% CI (−0.01,
    0.10)) but not support for public action directly. The updated message is
    equally effective but provides no added value. Both messages are more
    effective for audiences with lower message familiarity and higher
    misperceptions, including those with lower trust in climate scientists and
    right-leaning ideologies. Overall, scientific consensus messaging is an
    effective, non-polarizing tool for changing misperceptions, beliefs and
    worry across different audiences.

  abstract: >-
    The book examines the emerging approach of using qualitative methods, such
    as interviews and field observations, in the philosophy of science.
    Qualitative methods are gaining popularity among philosophers of science as
    more and more scholars are resorting to empirical work in their study of
    scientific practices. At the same time, the results produced through
    empirical work are quite different from those gained through the kind of
    introspective conceptual analysis more typical of philosophy. This volume
    explores the benefits and challenges of an empirical philosophy of science
    and addresses questions such as: What do philosophers gain from empirical
    work? How can empirical research help to develop philosophical concepts? How
    do we integrate philosophical frameworks and empirical research? What
    constraints do we accept when choosing an empirical approach? What
    constraints does a pronounced theoretical focus impose on empirical work?
    Nine experts discuss their thoughts and empirical results in the chapters of
    this book with the aim of providing readers with an answer to these
    questions. .

  abstract: >-
    From the era of slavery to the present day, the first full history of black
    America’s shocking mistreatment as unwilling and unwitting experimental
    subjects at the hands of the medical establishment.Medical Apartheid is the
    first and only comprehensive history of medical experimentation on African
    Americans. Starting with the earliest encounters between black Americans and
    Western medical researchers and the racist pseudoscience that resulted, it
    details the ways both slaves and freedmen were used in hospitals for
    experiments conducted without their knowledge—a tradition that continues
    today within some black populations. It reveals how blacks have historically
    been prey to grave-robbing as well as unauthorized autopsies and
    dissections. Moving into the twentieth century, it shows how the
    pseudoscience of eugenics and social Darwinism was used to justify
    experimental exploitation and shoddy medical treatment of blacks, and the
    view that they were biologically inferior, oversexed, and unfit for adult
    responsibilities. Shocking new details about the government’s notorious
    Tuskegee experiment are revealed, as are similar, less-well-known medical
    atrocities conducted by the government, the armed forces, prisons, and
    private institutions. The product of years of prodigious research into
    medical journals and experimental reports long undisturbed, Medical
    Apartheid reveals the hidden underbelly of scientific research and makes
    possible, for the first time, an understanding of the roots of the African
    American health deficit. At last, it provides the fullest possible context
    for comprehending the behavioral fallout that has caused black Americans to
    view researchers—and indeed the whole medical establishment—with such deep
    distrust. No one concerned with issues of public health and racial justice
    can afford not to read Medical Apartheid, a masterful book that will stir up
    both controversy and long-needed debate.

  abstract: >-
    While people’s views about science are related to identity factors (e.g.
    political orientation) and to knowledge of scientific theories, knowledge
    about how science works in general also plays an important role. To test
    this claim, we administered two detailed assessments about the practices of
    science to a demographically representative sample of the US public (N =
    1500), along with questions about the acceptance of evolution, climate
    change, and vaccines. Participants’ political and religious views predicted
    their acceptance of scientific claims, as in prior work. But a greater
    knowledge of the nature of science and a more mature view of how to mitigate
    scientific disagreements each related positively to acceptance. Importantly,
    the positive effect of scientific thinking on acceptance held regardless of
    participants’ political ideology or religiosity. Increased attention to
    developing people’s knowledge of how science works could thus help to combat
    resistance to scientific claims across the political and religious spectrum.

    It has long been thought that science is our best hope for realizing
    objective knowledge, but that, to deliver on this promise, it must be value
    free. Things are not so simple, however, as recent work in science studies
    makes clear. The contributors to this volume investigate where and how
    values are involved in science, and examine the implications of this
    involvement for ideals of objectivity.

  abstract: >-
    Feminist epistemologies consider ways in which gender (among other social
    factors) influences knowledge. In this article, I want to consider a
    particular kind of feminist empiricism that has been called feminist radical
    empiricism (where the empiricism, not the feminism, is radical). I am
    particularly interested in this view's treatment of values as empirical, and
    consequently up for revision on the basis of empirical evidence. Proponents
    of this view cite the fact that it allows us to talk about certain things
    such as racial and gender equality as objective facts: not just whether we
    have achieved said equality in our society, but whether we are, in fact, all
    equal. I will raise the concern that the way in which they model the role of
    values in epistemology may be a problematic idealization of the
    open-mindedness of human agents. In some cases, resistance to value-change
    cannot be diagnosed as a failure to respond adequately to evidence. If so,
    the strategy of empirically testing our values that some feminist radical
    empiricists suggest may not be as useful a tool for social change as they
    think.
