## Materials

Based on the EFA results in study 1, [author1] selected a short list of 18 items to focus on moving forward.  This selection was based, in part, on the EFA results from study 1:  items that did not load on to any factors were dropped, as were items that loaded on to the scientism factor.  The scientism factor was dropped in part because @LukicDelineatingScientismScience2023 reported a scale intended to measure scientism specifically; and because we came to believe that, for the purposes of understanding the dynamics of public scientific controversies, scientism could be reduced to the idea that science is especially trustworthy.  

[author3] and [author4] joined the project in January 2024, and all four authors authors together reviewed this shorter list, making initial revisions based on our impressions of which items seemed to be vague or otherwise difficult to understand.  Partway through the iterative data collection and analysis process, a 19th item was added to the list. 

For this study, items were arranged into 3 blocks of 5-7 items each, roughly corresponding to latent variables identified in the study 1 EFA.  In Qualtrics, we prepared a survey in which participants were randomly allocated to a single block.  Participants were presented with the item text, a 5-point agree/disagree Likert scale (later expanded to a 7-point scale), and a free text response box.  They were instructed to "Please indicate how much you agree with each of the following statements. Then, in the text box, please write a few sentences explaining why you answered the way you did." After completing the survey, participants were compensated USD 2.67. 

For study 2, besides participant responses to the items, no other data was collected or used.  

This study was to determined to be exempt from IRB review under Category 2.(i) by DJH, and self-exempt determination was acknowledged by the UC Merced IRB on February 27, 2024 (protocol #UCM2024-30). 

## Data

Data collection and analysis was conducted iteratively, alternating between collection and analysis, until saturation was reached for all items across two consecutive iterations.  Ultimately, 5 iterations were run, all during March 2024.  

In each iteration, participants were recruited on Prolific.  In iterations 1-3, participants had to be adult US residents; no other screeners were used.  We set the target quota for 10 participants per block; except in iteration 3, which had only a single block (a subset of items that had not yet achieved saturation) and for which 15 participants were recruited.  Based on study 1, we knew the platform tended to undersample political conservatives and participants with only a high school education.  Because there is significant interest in conservative trust in science — or lack therefore — we wanted to be confident that the VISS would be useful in studying these groups.  We therefore ran two final iterations, one for each of these groups, using all 3 blocks, 10 participants per block, and an additional screener for the target group. 

Across 5 iterations, we collected a total of 875 text responses from 141 participants.  

## Analysis

After the quota was achieved for a given iteration, responses were retrieved from Qualtrics in spreadsheet form and analyzed by all authors, first independently and together in weekly lab group meetings.  We focused on responses that indicated confusion or uncertainty, either explicit or implied, and responses that deviated from the intended meaning of the item.  

If qualitative analysis indicated that an item was frequently misinterpreted or regarded as confusing, all authors worked together to develop alternative wording.  This rewording was then used in future iterations.  An item was considered to have achieved "saturation" when we all of the responses across two iterations appeared to indicate that it was understood by the participants as intended.

  ~ A primary aim of science is to improve our knowledge and understanding of the world. 

aims.2	
  ~ A primary aim of science is to improve our understanding of threats to human health and the environment.

aims.3	
  ~ A primary aim of science is to stimulate economic growth with new technology. 

coi.1	
  ~ Scientists will report conclusions that they think will get them more funding even if the data does not fully support that conclusion.

coi.2	
  ~ Special interests can always find an scientist-for-hire who will support their point of view. 

consensus.1	
  ~ The consensus of the scientific community is based on social status and prestige rather than evidence. 

consensus.2	
  ~ Scientists never disagree with each other about the answers to scientific questions. 

fallible.1	
  ~ Once a scientific theory has been established, it is never changed. 

fallible.2	
  ~ When a scientific theory changes or is revised, it means that the research that went into it initially was flawed. 

ir	
  ~ Scientists should be more cautious about accepting a hypothesis when doing so could have serious social consequences. 

nonsubj.1	
  ~ When analyzing data, scientists should let the data speak for itself rather than offering their own interpretation. 

nonsubj.2	
  ~ Good scientific research is always free of assumptions and speculation.

pluralism.1	
  ~ Scientific investigations always require laboratory experiments.

pluralism.3	
  ~ All scientists use the same strict requirements for determining when empirical data confirm a tested hypothesis. 

stdpt	
  ~ Scientists from marginalized backgrounds can provide valuable insights that other scientists are likely to miss. 

valueconflict	
  ~ When scientific findings conflict with my core values, it's appropriate to be especially skeptical. 

vfi.1	
  ~ The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values.

vfi.2	
  ~ Scientists do not use imagination or creativity because doing so interferes with objectivity. 

waitpolicy	
  ~ Public policy should wait until all relevant scientific questions have been settled.
