# Study 2

In reviewing the results of study 1, we noted some counterintuitive combinations of items in the EFA.  For example, item `ir.1`, "Standards of scientific evidence are different in different situations," was intended to express the argument from inductive risk.  This argument has been highly influential in recent philosophy of science *[cites]*.  It claims that *[summary]*.  From this perspective, *legitimate* standards of evidence can be *appropriately* different in different situations, because of factors like different downstream non-epistemic consequences.  

However, in the EFA, `ir.1` was positively correlated with items such as 

- `coi.1`: Scientists will report conclusions that they think will get them more grant money even if the data does not fully support that conclusion.
- `consensus.3`: The consensus of the scientific community is based on social status and prestige rather than evidence. 

These items all loaded onto a factor that we tentatively labelled `cynicism`, since taken together the items seemed to express a cynical view about the epistemic reliability of scientists.  

In trying to understand why `ir.1` might have these correlations, we realized it could be read as claiming that scientists *illegitimately* use different standards in different situations, for example to purportedly justify a predetermined conclusion.  

We conjectured that this construct validity issue might explain the mediocre EFA fit, as different interpretations of the prompt caused a kind of measurement error that, in turn, lead to correlation attenuation *[cite]*.  We therefore decided to undertake a qualitative study to address construct validity.  

## Materials

Based on the EFA results in study 1, the lead author selected a slightly smaller list of 18 items to focus on moving forward.  All authors together reviewed these items, making initial revisions based on our impressions of which items seemed to be vague or otherwise difficult to understand.  Partway through the iterative data collection and analysis process, a 19th item was added to the list. 

Items were arranged into 3 blocks of 5-7 items each.  In Qualtrics, we prepared a survey in which participants were randomly allocated to a single block.  Participants were presented with the item text, a 5-point agree/disagree Likert scale (later expanded to a 7-point scale), and a free text response box.  They were instructed to "Please indicate how much you agree with each of the following statements. Then, in the text box, please write a few sentences explaining why you answered the way you did." After completing the survey, participants were compensated USD 2.67. 

For study 2, besides participant responses to the items, no other data was collected or used.

## Data

Data collection and analysis was conducted iteratively, alternating between collection and analysis, until saturation was reached for all items across two consecutive iterations.  Ultimately, 5 iterations were run, all during March 2024.  

In each iteration, participants were recruited on Prolific.  In iterations 1-3, participants had to be adult US residents; no other screeners were used.  We set the target quota for 10 participants per block; except in iteration 3, which had only a single block (a subset of items that had not yet achieved saturation) and for which 15 participants were recruited.  Based on previous experience with Prolific, we knew the platform tended to undersample political conservatives and participants with only a high school education.  Because there is significant interest in conservative trust in science — or lack therefore — we wanted to be confident that the VISS would be useful in studying these groups.  We therefore ran two final iterations, one for each of these groups, using all 3 blocks, 10 participants per block, and an additional screener for the target group. 

Across 5 iterations, we collected a total of 875 text responses from 141 participants.  

## Analysis

After the quota was achieved for a given iteration, responses were retrieved from Qualtrics in spreadsheet form and analyzed by all authors.  We focused on responses that indicated confusion or uncertainty, either explicit or implied, and responses that deviated from the intended meaning of the item.  

If qualitative analysis indicated that an item was frequently misinterpreted or regarded as confusing, all authors worked together to develop alternative wording.  This rewording was then used in future iterations.  An item was considered to have achieved "saturation" when we all of the responses across two iterations appeared to indicate that it was understood by the participants.
